## $Id$
##

##  ADSPDiscard { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Reject messages which are determined to be "suspicious" according to the
##  sending domain's published signing procedure (ADSP) record if that record
##  also recommends rejection of such messages.

# ADSPDiscard		No

##  ADSPNoSuchDomain { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Reject messages which are determined to be from nonexistent domains during
##  the Author Domain Signing Practises (ADSP) check.

# ADSPNoSuchDomain	No

##  AllowSHA1Only { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  By default, the filter will refuse to start if signing mode is enabled
##  but rsa-sha1 will be used (either because it is the only algorithm
##  available or because it was explicitly requested) since this violates
##  the strong recommendations of RFC4871 section 3.3.

# AllowSHA1Only		no

##  AlwaysAddARHeader { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Add an "Authentication-Results:" header even to unsigned messages
##  from domains with no "signs all" policy.  The reported DKIM result
##  will be "none" in such cases.  Normally unsigned mail from non-strict
##  domains does not cause the results header to be added.

# AlwaysAddARHeader	no

##  AlwaysSignHeaders header-list
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specifies a list of headers whose names should appear in signatures
##  whether or not they were signed, preventing their later addition.

# AlwaysSignHeaders	header1,header2,...

##  AuthservID string
##  	default (local host name)
##
##  Defines the "authserv-id" token to be used when generating 
##  Authentication-Results headers after message verification.

# AuthservID		example.com

##  AuthservIDWithJobID
##  	default "no"
##
##  Appends a "/" followed by the MTA's job ID to the "authserv-id" token
##  when generating Authentication-Results headers after message verification.

# AuthservIDWithJobId	no

##  AutoRestart { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Indicate whether or not the filter should arrange to restart automatically
##  if it crashes.

# AutoRestart		No

##  AutoRestartCount n
##  	default 0
##
##  Sets the maximum automatic restart count.  After this number of
##  automatic restarts, the filter will give up and terminate.  A value of 0
##  implies no limit.

# AutoRestartCount	0

##  AutoRestartRate n/t[u]
##  	default (none)
## 
##  Sets the maximum automatic restart rate.  See the dkim-filter.conf(5)
##  man page for the format of this parameter.

# AutoRestartRate	n/tu

##  Background { yes | no }
##  	default "yes"
##
##  Indicate whether or not the filter should run in the background.

# Background		Yes

##  BaseDirectory path
##  	default (none)
##
##  Causes the filter to change to the named directory before beginning
##  operation.  Thus, cores will be dumped here and configuration files
##  are read relative to this location.

# BaseDirectory		/var/run/dkim-filter

##  BodyLengths { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Indicate whether or not signatures with body length tags should be
##  generated.

# BodyLengths		No

##  Canonicalization hdrcanon[/bodycanon]
##  	default "simple/simple"
##
##  Select canonicalizations to use when signing.  If the "bodycanon" is
##  omitted, "simple" is used.  Valid values for each are "simple" and
##  "relaxed".

# Canonicalization	simple/simple

##  ClockDrift n
##  	default 300
##
##  Specify the tolerance range for expired signatures or signatures
##  which appear to have timestamps in the future, allowing for clock
##  drift.

##  Diagnostics { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Specifies whether or not signatures with header diagnostic tags should
##  be generated.

# Diagnostics		No

##  DNSTimeout n
##  	default 10
##
##  Specify the time in seconds to wait for replies from the nameserver when
##  requesting keys or signing policies.

# DNSTimeout		10

##  Domain name[,...]
##  	default (none)
##
##  Specify for which domain(s) signing should be done.  No default; must
##  be specified for signing.

Domain			ant.gliwice.pl

##  DontSignMailTo	addrlist
##  	default (none)
##
##  Gives a list of recipient addresses or address patterns whose mail should
##  not be signed.  Wildcard ("*") characters are allowed.

# DontSignMailTo	addr1,addr2,...

##  EnableCoredumps { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  On systems which have support for such, requests that the kernel dump
##  core even though the process may change user ID during its execution.

# EnableCoredumps	no

##  ExternalIgnoreList filename
##
##  Names a file from which a list of externally-trusted hosts is read.
##  These are hosts which are allowed to send mail through you for signing.
##  Automatically contains 127.0.0.1.  See man page for file format.

# ExternalIgnoreList	filename

##  FixCRLF { yes | no }
##
##  Requests that the library convert "naked" CR and LF characters to
##  CRLFs during canonicalization.  The default is "no".

# FixCRLF 		no

##  InternalHosts filename
##
##  Names a file from which a list of internal hosts is read.  These are
##  hosts from which mail should be signed rather than verified.
##  Automatically contains 127.0.0.1.  See man page for file format.

# InternalHosts		filename

##  KeepTemporaryFiles { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  If set, causes temporary files generated during message signing or
##  verifying to be left behind for debugging use.  Not for normal operation;
##  can fill your disks quite fast on busy systems.

# KeepTemporaryFiles	no

##  KeyFile filename
##
##  Specifies the path to the private key to use when signing.  Ignored if
##  Keylist is set.  No default; must be specified for signing.

KeyFile			/etc/mail/dkim-milter/ant.gliwice.pl.key

##  KeyList filename
##
##  Specifies the path to the list of keys and signing domains to be applied
##  by the signing filter.  The entries in this file should be of the form:
##
##  	pattern:domain:keypath
##
##  ...where "pattern" is a pattern of user@host to match, with "*" being
##  allowed as a wildcard; "domain" is the signing domain; and "keypath"
##  is the path to the private key to use to generate signatures for such
##  users.  The selector used will be the filename portion of "keypath".
##  Blank lines are ignored, and the hash ("#") character is interpreted
##  as the beginning of a comment.  See dkim-filter.conf(5) for more
##  information.

# KeyList		/var/db/dkim/keylist

##  LocalADSP filename
##
##  Allows specification of local ADSP overrides for domains.  This should be
##  a path to a file containing entries, one per line, with comments and
##  blank lines allowed.  An entry is of the form "domain:policy" where
##  "domain" is either a fully-qualified domain name (e.g. "foo.example.com")
##  or a subdomain name preceded by a period (e.g. ".example.com"), and
##  "policy" is either "unknown", "all", or "discardable", as per the current
##  ADSP draft specification.  This allows local overrides of policies to
##  enforce for domains which either don't publish ADSP or publish weaker
##  policies than the verifier would like to enforce.

# LocalADSP		/etc/mail/local-adsp-rules

##  LogWhy { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  If logging is enabled (see Syslog below), issues very detailed logging
##  about the logic behind the filter's decision to either sign a message
##  or verify it.  The logic behind the decision is non-trivial and can be
##  confusing to administrators not familiar with its operation.  A
##  description of how the decision is made can be found in the OPERATIONS
##  section of the dkim-filter(8) man page.  This causes a large increase
##  in the amount of log data generated for each message, so it should be
##  limited to debugging use and not enabled for general operation.

# LogWhy		no

##  MacroList macro[=value][,...]
##
##  Gives a set of MTA-provided macros which should be checked to see
##  if the sender has been determined to be a local user and therefore
##  whether or not signing should be done.  See dkim-filter.conf(5) for
##  more information.

##  MaximumSignedBytes n
##
##  Don't sign more than "n" bytes of the message.  The default is to 
##  sign the entire message.  Setting this implies "BodyLengths".

##	n+	if a length limit was presented in the signature, no more than
##  		n bytes may have been added

# Minimum		n

##  Mode [sv]
##  	default sv
##
##  Indicates which mode(s) of operation should be provided.  "s" means
##  "sign", "v" means "verify".

##  	default (none)
##
##  Defines a list of headers which, if present on a message, must be
##  signed for the signature to be considered acceptable.

# Quarantine		No

##  QueryCache { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Instructs the DKIM library to maintain its own local cache of keys and
##  policies retrieved from DNS, rather than relying on the nameserver for
##  caching service.  Useful if the nameserver being used by the filter is
##  not local.  The filter must be compiled with the QUERY_CACHE flag to enable
##  this feature, since it adds a library dependency.

# QueryCache		No

Selector		mail

##  SendADSPReports { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Specifies whether or not the filter should generate report mail back
##  to senders when the ADSP (Author Domain Signing Practises) check fails for
##  a message.  See dkim-filter.conf(5) for details.

# SendADSPReports	No

##  SendReports { yes | no }
##  	default "no"

# SignHeaders		header1,header2,...

##  Socket socketspec
##
##  Names the socket where this filter should listen for milter connections
##  from the MTA.  Required.  Should be in one of these forms:
##
##  inet:port@address		to listen on a specific interface

##  StrictTestMode { yes | no }
##  	default "no"
##
##  Selects strict CRLF mode during testing (see the "-t" command line
